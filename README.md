# Jerren Trifan's Advent-of-Code 2023 Solutions

This is my first Advent of Code (December 2023) and I am doing it all in TypeScript. Turned off Copilot for these solutions.

My solutions may not be the most efficient or optimal, but I am aiming to solve every problem by myself, in a somewhat readable format. I'll try to document my solutions when possible.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run ./src/day<number>/day<number>.ts
```

## File/Folder Structure

All relevant files are in the src folder.

- Source files are in the format of ```day/day<number>.ts```

- Data is in the format of ```day<number>/example.txt```

- Instructions are in the format of ```day<number>/instructions.txt```

- Script to remove answers from the instructions files is ```removeAnswers.ts```

- ```util.ts``` contains a file loading wrapper function, other math util functions.
